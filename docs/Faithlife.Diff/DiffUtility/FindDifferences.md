# DiffUtility.FindDifferences&lt;T&gt; method (1 of 2)

Finds the differences between the two lists.

```csharp
public static IReadOnlyList<ValueTuple<IndexRange, IndexRange>> FindDifferences<T>(IReadOnlyList<T> first, IReadOnlyList<T> second)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | The type of item in the lists. |
| first | The first list. |
| second | The second list. |

## Return Value

A sequence of pairs that indicate the differences between the lists.

## Remarks

Each pair identifies a range of items in each list. The items before and after each range are the same in both lists; the items in each range are the difference. One of the two ranges can be empty, but the index of the range still indicates where the missing items are.

EqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;.Default is used to compare items.
