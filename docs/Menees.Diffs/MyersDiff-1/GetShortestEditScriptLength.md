# MyersDiff&lt;T&gt;.GetShortestEditScriptLength method

Calculates the length of the "shortest edit script" as defined in Myers's paper. Note: This may not be the same as the Count property of an EditScript instance returned by Execute(). If an EditScript instance has any Edits with Length &gt; 1, then those groupings will make EditScript.Count less than GetSESLength(). Similarly, an Edit with EditType Change should be thought of as a combined Delete and Insert for the specified Length.

```csharp
public int GetShortestEditScriptLength()
```
