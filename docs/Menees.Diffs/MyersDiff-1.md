# MyersDiff&lt;T&gt; class

This class implements the differencing algorithm from "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm And Its Variations" by Eugene W. Myers. It is the standard algorithm used by the UNIX diff utilities. This implementation diffs two comparable lists. It is typically used with lists of hash values where each hash corresponds to a line of text. Then it can be used to diff two text files on a line-by-line basis.

```csharp
public sealed class MyersDiff<T>
    where T : IComparable<T>
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [MyersDiff](MyersDiff-1/MyersDiff.md)(…) |  |
| [Execute](MyersDiff-1/Execute.md)() | Returns an EditScript instance that gives all the Edits necessary to transform A into B. |
| [GetLongestCommonSubsequence](MyersDiff-1/GetLongestCommonSubsequence.md)() | Returns the longest common subsequence from A and B. |
| [GetLongestCommonSubsequenceLength](MyersDiff-1/GetLongestCommonSubsequenceLength.md)() | Calculates the length that the LCS should be without actually determining the LCS. |
| [GetReverseShortestEditScriptLength](MyersDiff-1/GetReverseShortestEditScriptLength.md)() | Gets the length of the "shortest edit script" by running the algorithm in reverse. We should always have GetSESLength() == GetReverseSESLength(). |
| [GetShortestEditScriptLength](MyersDiff-1/GetShortestEditScriptLength.md)() | Calculates the length of the "shortest edit script" as defined in Myers's paper. Note: This may not be the same as the Count property of an EditScript instance returned by Execute(). If an EditScript instance has any Edits with Length &gt; 1, then those groupings will make EditScript.Count less than GetSESLength(). Similarly, an Edit with EditType Change should be thought of as a combined Delete and Insert for the specified Length. |
| [GetSimilarity](MyersDiff-1/GetSimilarity.md)() | Returns a similary index between 0 and 1 inclusive. 0 means A and B are completely different. 1 means they are exactly alike. The similarity index is calculated as twice the length of the LCS divided by the sum of A and B's lengths. |
